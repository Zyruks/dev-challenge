### Love the Challenge

I got some trouble styling the list decoration i research and found how to make it. The float: inline-end give me a hard time because of google chrome compatibility but all ready.

The List decoration didn't know was that difficult to change but read on [Csstrick](https://css-tricks.com/list-style-recipes/).

Very helpful!!!
